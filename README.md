# URL Directory Checker

## Overview

This Go script is designed to check a list of URLs against a list of directories and write the successful URLs to an output file. It can be useful for verifying the existence of specific directories on a web server.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following:

- Go installed on your system. You can download and install Go from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/).
- A text file containing a list of URLs and a text file containing a list of directories. Each URL and directory should be on a separate line.

## Usage

1. **Download the script**: Download the `tor.go` file from this repository to your local machine.

2. **Prepare your directory list**: Create a text file containing a list of directories you want to check. Each directory should be on a separate line. Save this file with a `.txt` extension.

3. **Prepare your URL list**: Create a text file containing a list of URLs you want to check. Each URL should be on a separate line. Save this file with a `.txt` extension.

4. **Run the script**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the `tor.go` file and your directory list file, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    go run tor.go -rate=<rate_limit> <url> <directory_list_file> [<output_file>]
    ```

    - Replace `<rate_limit>` with the desired rate limit for HTTP requests (requests per second). This is an optional parameter. If not specified, a default rate limit of 10 requests per second will be used.
    - Replace `<url>` with the base URL you want to check against the directories.
    - Replace `<directory_list_file>` with the path to the text file containing the list of directories.
    - Replace `<output_file>` (optional) with the desired output file where successful URLs will be written. If not specified, successful URLs will be printed to the terminal.

    Example command:

    ```bash
    go run tor.go -rate=5 https://example.com directory_list.txt output.txt
    ```

5. **Review the output**: Once the script completes, review the output to see which URLs were successful. If you specified an output file, check the contents of that file for the successful URLs.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the script, refer to the following troubleshooting steps:

- **Verify URLs and directories**: Double-check the URLs and directories in your list to ensure they are correctly formatted and accessible.
- **Check for errors**: Look for any error messages printed in the terminal when running the script. These messages can provide clues to potential issues.
- **Increase verbosity**: Add more print statements or logging to the script to track progress and identify any potential issues.
- **Test with a subset**: Try running the script with a small subset of URLs and directories to isolate any specific issues.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have permission to access the URLs and that they are publicly accessible.
- Be mindful of rate limits and server capacities to avoid overwhelming the server with requests.
