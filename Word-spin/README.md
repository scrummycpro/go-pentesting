# Sentiment Analysis GUI

This Python application provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for performing sentiment analysis on text input using the TextBlob library. The application allows users to input text manually, upload a text file, or use right-click operations (copy, paste) for convenience. The sentiment analysis results are displayed in real-time and saved to an SQLite database for future reference.

## Features

- Input text manually or upload a text file for sentiment analysis.
- Support for right-click operations (copy, paste) within the text entry widget.
- Analyze sentiment with real-time feedback displayed in the GUI.
- Save sentiment analysis results to an SQLite database for record-keeping.
- Ability to trigger sentiment analysis by pressing the Enter key.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (standard Python GUI toolkit)
- TextBlob (library for processing textual data)
- SQLite3 (built-in Python library for SQLite database)

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-gui.git
```

2. Install the required Python dependencies:

```

```

## Usage

1. Run the application by executing the following command in your terminal:

```
python sentiment_analysis_gui.py
