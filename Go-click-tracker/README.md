# File Click Tracker Server

The File Click Tracker Server is a simple HTTP server written in Go that serves files from a directory and tracks the number of clicks for each file. It can be used for security purposes in DevOps environments to monitor access to sensitive files and detect potential security incidents.

## Features

- **Serve Files**: The server serves files from the current directory over HTTP, allowing users to access them via their web browser.

- **Click Tracking**: Every time a file is accessed, the server tracks the number of clicks for that file.

- **Statistics**: Users can view click statistics for all files served by the server by accessing the `/stats` endpoint.

## Usage

1. **Server Setup**: Ensure that Go is installed on your system. Clone or download the repository containing the server code.

2. **File Placement**: Place the files you want to serve in the same directory as the server executable. These files can include documents, configuration files, or any other resources you want to monitor.

3. **Server Execution**: Run the server by executing the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   go run server.go -port <port_number>
   ```

   Replace `<port_number>` with the desired port number for the server. If no port number is specified, it will default to port 8080.

4. **Access Files**: Users can access files served by the server by navigating to `http://<server_ip>:<port>/<file_name>` in their web browser.

5. **View Statistics**: Users can view click statistics for all files served by the server by accessing `http://<server_ip>:<port>/stats` in their web browser.

## Security Implications

The File Click Tracker Server can be used for security purposes in DevOps environments in the following ways:

1. **File Access Monitoring**: Monitor access to sensitive files and resources by tracking the number of clicks for each file. This can help identify unauthorized access attempts and potential security breaches.

2. **Audit Trail**: Maintain an audit trail of file access events, including the number of clicks and the timestamp of each access. This information can be used for forensic analysis and compliance auditing purposes.

3. **Incident Response**: Detect and respond to security incidents in real-time by monitoring file access patterns and identifying unusual or suspicious activity. This can help mitigate the impact of security breaches and prevent further unauthorized access.

4. **Policy Enforcement**: Enforce security policies and access controls by monitoring file access and enforcing restrictions based on predefined rules and policies. This can help ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and industry best practices.

5. **Forensic Analysis**: Use click statistics and access logs for forensic analysis during security investigations. Analyze file access patterns, identify potential security threats, and gather evidence for incident response and remediation.
